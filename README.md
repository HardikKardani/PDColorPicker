üé® **PDColorPicker** is an open source iOS library that lets developers include a color picker in their apps, allowing users to easily select colors in a variety of formats. This library is open for collaboration with the community so anyone is invited to submit issues or pull requests.

## üìÑ Requirements

* iOS 9.0 or later (iOS 11.0+ for drag and drop)
* Xcode 9.0 or later
* Swift 3.2 or later

## üíª Installation

### Cocoapods

PDColorPicker is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

If you have not done so already, run `pod setup` from the root directory of your application.

To install `PDColorPicker`, simply add the following line to the Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PDColorPicker'
```

This line should be added to the app's target so that it looks something like this:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target 'TARGET_NAME' do
  pod 'PDColorPicker', '~> 0.2.0'

  # other pods...
end
```

Next run `pod install` from the Terminal while inside the directory that contains the Podfile.

Open the newly created `.xcworkspace` file and build the project to make `PDColorPicker` available.

**Note**: Be sure to always work inside the `.xcworkspace` file and **not** the `.xcodeproj` file, otherwise Xcode will not be able to locate the dependencies and `PDColorPicker` will not be accessible.

### Carthage

PDColorPicker is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage).

If you haven't installed Carthage yet, use Homebrew to install it:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Create a Cartfile inside the root project directory with the following line (or add this line if you already have a Cartfile):

```
github "pdil/PDColorPicker" ~> 0.2.0
```

* From the root project directory, run `carthage update` from the Terminal to build the framework.
* Select the project in the Project Navigator in Xcode (blue icon).
* Open the "General" tab on the top bar.
* Drag `PDColorPicker.framework` from the `Carthage/build` folder into the "Embedded Binaries" section.

### Manual (not recommended)

* Download the `.swift` files inside [PDColorPicker/Classes](https://github.com/pdil/PDColorPicker/tree/master/PDColorPicker/Classes) and add them to your project.
* Add the files to the appropriate target(s) within the project.
* Use the `PDColorPicker` classes as you normally would.

## üìù Usage

```swift
import UIKit
import PDColorPicker  // 1.

class MyViewController: UIViewController, Dimmable {
  
    // ...
  
    func presentColorPicker() {
        // 2.
        let colorPickerVC = PDColorPickerViewController(initialColor: .blue, tintColor: .black)

        // 3.
        colorPickerVC.completion = {
            [weak self] newColor in

            // 7.
            self?.undim()

            guard let color = newColor else {
                print("The user tapped cancel, no color was selected.")
            }

            let rgb = color.rgba

            print("A new color was selected! RGB: \(rgb.r), \(rgb.g), \(rgb.b)")
         }
  
         // 4.
         dim() // see Dimmable documentation for extra options
    
         // 5.
         present(colorPickerVC, animated: true)
    }
  
    // ...
  
}
```

1. Import the  `PDColorPicker` framework.
2. Instantiate a new `PDColorPickerViewController`.
3. Set the completion handler of the color picker, indicating what the presenting view controller should do with the color result. **Note**: this can also be set in the `PDColorPickerViewController` initializer.
4. Implement the `Dimmable` protocol and dim the presenting view controller (optional but highly recommended).
5. Present the color picker as a modal view controller.
6. Use the color picker to select a color. When **Save** or **Cancel** is tapped, the completion handler specified in the initializer will automatically provide the new color. If the user taps cancel, `nil` is returned.
7. Be sure to undim the view once the completion handler is called.

### Bonus

To achieve the white status bar while the presenting view controller is dimmed, set `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` to `YES` in your `Info.plist`.

You can also copy the code here into the plist file:
```
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<true/>
```

Next, in the _presenting_ view controller, include the following code:
```swift
override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
  return .lightContent
}
```

## üì≤ Drag and Drop

Drag and drop is also supported in projects that target iOS 11.0 or later.

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdil/PDColorPicker/master/Resources/drag-drop-demo-trimmed.gif" width=600>](https://giphy.com/gifs/6TNPgdZ3W4qMo/fullscreen)

See `PDColorReceiverExample` for an example on how to consume a color that is dragged into your app. The drag and drop implementation of `PDColorPicker` exposes a basic `UIColor` so that it can be read by apps that don't necessarily import `PDColorPicker`. 

Of course, if the destination app imports `PDColorPicker`, it will have access to the convenient `PDColor` class which it could instantiate with the received `UIColor`:

```swift
// droppedColor is a UIColor that arrived via a drag and drop interaction
let receivedColor = PDColor(color: droppedColor)

// make use of PDColor features
print(receivedColor.hex)
```
